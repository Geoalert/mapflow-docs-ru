   
Urban Mapping classes
=====================

Here is presented a list of classes for "Buildings" and "Construction" Mapping Models.
Here we aim to assign classes to the natural and man-made objects that have a clear interpretation either in satellite or in aerial imagery, however method is proposed to be extended to include more classes depending on the resulting accuracy in differenet urban domains.
